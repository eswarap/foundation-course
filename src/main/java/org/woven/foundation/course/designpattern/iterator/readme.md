The <b>Iterator Design Pattern</b> is a <u>behavioral design pattern</u> that allows you to traverse through a collection of objects 
without exposing the underlying representation of the collection. This pattern is particularly useful when 
you need to access elements of a collection sequentially.

<b>Key Concepts</b>:
<b>Iterator Interface</b>: 
Defines the methods for accessing and traversing elements.

<b>Concrete Iterator</b>: 
Implements the Iterator interface and keeps track of the current position in the traversal.

<b>Aggregate Interface</b>: 
Defines a method to create an iterator.

<b>Concrete Aggregate</b>: 
Implements the Aggregate interface and returns an instance of the Concrete Iterator.
