The <b>Factory Design Pattern</b> is a <u>creational design pattern</u> used in Java to create objects 
without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful 
when you have a superclass with multiple subclasses and you need to return one of the subclasses based on some input.
